### About Me
- I’m a software developer and I just love logic grinding.
- Currently focusing on 2 things:-
-   First is AI, just diving into what it is and getting to know more about llms, models and actually trying to bridge the gap b/w softwares and AI.
-   Secondly, working on my own browser (mainly rendering engine) ! It's my dream project. Difficult but wanna make a one that beats Blink,Servo,etc.. (NO DOUBT, WILL DO IT MAN !)

Generally speaking, I know Python, Cpp, a bit of javascript and is currently learning Rust for my browser project.
Got my experience with lots of libraries (absolute fun) like Django, Flask, SDL, SFML, Pygame and what not man ! It's just read a documentation and use it in ur project.

Recently got myself a **new laptop for free (GIGABYTE AERO X16 - 32 GB RAM, 1TB SSD, NVIDIA RTX 5070 GPU + COPILOT + PC)** through Summer of Making by Hackclub & Github.
Check out my post !

Tried for GSOC 2025 (Django as organization) and is set to getting selected for GSOC 2026.
