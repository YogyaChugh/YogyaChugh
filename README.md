# Hey, I'm Yogya 👋

19-year-old developer building tools that matter. Curious about **neural networks**, **systems programming** and **browsers**, the web mystery.

Currently working on **Webelo** (independent browser engine) and GSOC 2026.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages**: Python • Rust • C++  
**Web & Backend**: Django • Flask  
**Desktop**: Flet (cross-platform GUI)  
**Game Dev**: Pygame • SDL • SFML (My side interest)  

---

## 📌 Current Projects

**Android Native for Python/Rust** - Making native Android development accessible from Python and Rust, not just Java/Kotlin cause even though libraries exist, they ain't native and create bulky apps (mine was 200 mb lol). Semester project (team of 3).

**Webelo** - Independent rendering engine (browser) with zero dependencies which can be used separately or can be embedded in any language/GUI library (e.g. Pygame, etc..) . Aiming for completion by July 2026, cause my future projects rely on it.

**Pippo** - 40% complete. A navigation robot that helps students and people navigate around campus. Combines robotics with practical utility.

## 🎓 Experience, Contribution, Achievements blah blah

- Worked through my summer of 2025 spanning 3 months (July-September) coded 5 projects totalling 394.5 hours (obviously not contiguous lol) and got myself a GIGABYTE laptop (Ryzen 7, RTX 5070, 32GB RAM) via Hack Club's Summer of Making for free.
- Built and deployed production ready android app & server (using FastAPI) for my uncle's business
- Attempted GSOC 2025 (Django) — Applying for GSOC 2026
- Contributed to Django, Hack Club, and my personal projects lol
- Created some fun games for myself like the one below and some api's using django and fastapi sometimes, juggling based on requirements.
- Won some college coding competitions but i really can't have this readme reach any more linkedin stuff.

## 🧠 Currently Learning

Deep diving into **neural networks** and ML fundamentals. Exploring them for fun :)

## Failures
- I know wierd, but they actually taught me
- GSOC 2025, but that got me into how to contribute in open source and actually opened my way into knowing so much stuff cause i got my idea for independent browser from open source only.
- SIH 2024, 2025 taught me about working with teams as we hustled together working on our project on **Smart Tourism** juggling with Blockchain, geofencing, maps and softwares. It was actually the gateway for knowing the importance about why DevOps exists.


## 🎮 Fun Stuff

I made this cross-platform ( web too ) game in pygame with a deployed server, it's not bad. It's a very old game which i remade, try if u like [Timberly](https://yogyachugh.github.io/Timberly/) . It's got a leaderboard if u wanna compete too.
