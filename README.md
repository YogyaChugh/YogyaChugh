### About Me
- I’m a software developer who enjoys working on **big, ambitious ideas** — stuff like a **custom web browser**, **website builder**, **my own server**, and more.
- Currently diving into **AI** and loving the logic behind it.
- I’m not here for buzzwords — just building things I find cool, useful, or fun.

---

### Languages & Tools I Use
```bash
Languages:   Python, C++, JavaScript (Rust is growing on me)
Frameworks:  SDL / SDL2, SFML, Django, Flask, Pygame, Flet
Tools:       Git, Linux, VS Code, Coffee
```

---

### Stuff I’ve Built (Basic but Real)
These are all basic projects — nothing flashy, but all a part of learning and getting better:

- 🐍 Snake Game

- 🏦 Bankory – A Monopoly-style game

- 🌲 Timber Game

- ❓ Hangman

- 🧾 Input Textbox UI

- 🤖 Robot Control App

📌 Also tried out GSoC 2025 and SIH 2024 — didn’t make it, but learned a lot.

---

### Current Interests
- AI and how logic drives intelligence

- Rust (because it's fun breaking your brain a little)

- Backend systems, dev tools, and maybe making something that replaces something I already use

---

### Minimal Setup, Max Output
Coffee + Laptop + Internet = Ready to build
